# lineage

Run `npm run catalog -- lineage `. Add `--json` for structured data.

Present the records in plain language. Name missing evidence and stale dates. Never infer source-data accuracy from a catalogue entry.

Names are case insensitive. When ambiguous, show the candidates and let the operator choose the id. Writes require --actor with the responsible operator. Nothing sends, deletes or changes a source system.
